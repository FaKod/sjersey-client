The are many awesome REST frameworks out there, for Java and for Scala as well. Most of the concepts do cover the server side. Important I know, but where are the smart client side APIs/DSLs? There are some and I must confess, I dislike them all. So this is a try to create another one. One that I dislike to a lesser extend.

I like Jersey, a production ready REST client and server framework for REST. The server implementation follows the JAX-RS standard and has an awesome functionality. And since I know this framework best, it is my choice for the client side as well.

I wrote a little one-source-file Jersey wrapper for Scala. The REST services are operated by Neo4j Server, a NoSQL GraphDB. My specs tests are running against it. All objects have to be marshaled and unmarshaled in and to JSON. Jersey uses JAXB for that.

Unfortunately, this wrapper is far away from completeâ€¦
